# Window Traversal

## Abstract
We want to build a drone that cannot be traped in a room, a drone that will actively search for and escape its bounds thorugh an exit be it a door or a window. With this as our motivation we would build a robust system that detects and navigates through narrow passages.

## Workflow
- Write and test a code that would detect and relay information like size and distance from a rectangular frame fitted with Aruco Tags.
- Make a controller that generates trajectory and inputs to pass through the given frame.
- Try out the above on DJI Tello Drone and make adjustments to make it robust.
- Develop a system that won't require the use of Aruco Tags for frame detection and implement it on DJI Tello.
- Build a stable and well-performing drone upon which all of the above step are implemented.
